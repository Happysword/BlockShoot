1. Procedure to draw the blocks using their places in memory and having a boolean array to check if they should be drawn or not.
example in memory would be blockx db 20, 45, 20 ,45 , ...
			   blocky db 30,30, 60,60, ...
			   blockdrawn db 1,1,1,1,0, ...

2.Procedure that draws the shooters and moves them up and down according to arrow keys they will be saved using one point and drawn according to it.
example in memory for the points shooter1x dw 50 shooter1y dw 50 

3.Procedure to fire bullets from each shooter and saved in memory using one point having a limit on bullets shot per a certain time for a max of 5 bullets appearing on screen for every player.it also shifts the bullets every 10/100 of a second using the time interrupt.
example in memory bulletsP1x dw 100 ,200, ...
		   bulletsP1y dw 400,620, ...

4.Procedure to check for collision between the bullets and either the shooter or the blocks. if there was a hit the bullet would dissapear and the memory location would be deleted (set to zero). If the hit was on a block the block would disappear by setting the boolean value of it in blockDrawn to zero.

Also there is a timer and a score counter for each player that will be added at the end.

Notes: 
1-We will use 1024x768 pixels (1024 cloumn , 768 row) leave 168 pixels for the chat module that leaves 600 pixels for the game OR 640x480 or 800x600 we should leave 1/5 of the screen according to document.
2-We should add two modes for the game(easy and hard)?
3- should we use github?
4- comments for understanding , using variables for everything and procedures or macros only, think in  a high level language then translate.
